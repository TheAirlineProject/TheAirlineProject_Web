This is still VERY early in development - it will be a couple months before anything playable is live

Always looking for contributors and developers -- 

++Knowledge of HTML/CSS, and basic graphic design (Front-End)

+++Knowledge of associated frameworks (jQuery, Angular, CakePHP, etc)

Mailing list, TODOS, and roadmap coming soon!

Current dir structure:

pages/ - contains PHP helper pages for things like database imports and general use stuff that isn't part of the game (but could be)
scripts/ - contains bash scripts for handling various server tasks
tmp/ - contains any temporary files. these should be primarily info output and not required by any other files
xml/ - contains the xml data for airports, aircraft, and airlines that is imported to the database if you don't want to use the included DB
